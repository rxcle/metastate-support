# Rxcle Metastate

Metastate is a productivity plugin for Adobe InDesign and Photoshop that enables you to take named snapshots of the visibility and selection states of Layers (and Page Items in case of InDesign) and quickly switch between these states. The states are stored within your documents as non-critical metadata, which means that documents with states can still be opened and edited without having the Metastate plugin installed.

## Installation
Obtain and install **Metastate** via **Adobe Exchange**. Note that there is a separate edition for Photoshop and InDesign:

- [Metastate for Photoshop](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/e884d12e/metastate-for-photoshop)
- [Metastate for InDesign](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/c0cbd0ce/metastate-for-indesign)


After installation a new menu and Panel is available under the `Plugins` panel in InDesign or Photoshop.

## Usage
The full user manual is included with the plugin, but you can also find it here:
- [Help for Photoshop](./docs/help-ps.md)
- [Help for InDesign](./docs/help-id.md)
